# Churn-Modeling

1. This project express the view on various machine learning models along with their classification report.
2. It projects a clear view on each and evey model and also shows its accuracy.
3. An EDA has also been shown.

### EDA is shown on several aspects

## Models implemented

1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest
3. Naive Bayes Classifier
4. Decision Tree
5. KNN classifier
6. Support Vector Machine

 The above models are implemented and their accuracy is shown.
